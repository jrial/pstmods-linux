While practicing, some Mage students discovered a means to condense and store knowledge into a charm form. This particular charm contains the entire resource library of the famed Charon School of Mages. Unfortunately, the effects of this charm are fleeting and the user is rendered unintelligible for a short period of time.

NOTE: This charm can be used to "identify" unknown items. It can *only* be used on the quick item menu on the world screen. After the charm is used, the user must then enter their inventory screen and right-click (i.e., "examine") each item they want to identify. The charm will only allow the user to identify objects that are in his possession -- items in other character's inventories cannot be identified this way. The effects of this charm are temporary and must be used quickly.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~CHARM OF INFINITE RECALL

#63979 ~~~~~In exchange for helping him shed his curse, Reekwind put all the stories he knew in my journal:

The first of the stories was a tale of the "Alley of Dangerous Angles," the alleyway near where he'd set up kip. It used to be a street, but a great fire raged through it one night, setting the buildings and people a-flame, leaving just the skeletal frames of the houses... and their residents. The broken timbers of the old burnt buildings are what give the Alley its name. Apparently, several groups of thugs have now taken up residence there.

The second tale was the story of Ignus, the mad sorcerer who was responsible for creating the Alley of Dangerous Angles. Ignus was a powerful sorcerer who had been taught by one of the last of the Great Magi, and he burned with the Art, so much so it drove him to burning people and buildings when the urge struck him. One night, he unleashed his power on one of the streets in the Hive, burning it down and torching the residents. Whether out of revenge or justice, several minor mages in the Hive banded together and used their combined knowing of the Art to turn Ignus' body into a conduit to the Elemental Plane of Fire. They hoped the pain would kill him... it didn't. Apparently, it just caused Ignus to enter a deep sleep.

The third and last tale was the story of Pharod; apparently, Pharod was one a member of the "aristocracy" in Sigil, but he used his position to bend laws, cheat others, and even condemn innocent men. His acts were so deceitful that it damned his soul to the Lower Planes when he died - when he learned of this, he became afraid and looked for a way to dodge his fate. Apparently, he consulted several seers and was told that he would find a means of saving himself in the trash of Sigil. Pharod cast off his position of respect and became a King of Rags, sending his gang of Collectors to scour the Sigil streets in search of something that would set his soul free... but he knows not what it is.

#63709 ~~~~~DUSTMAN EMBALMING CHARM, GREATER
Invokes: "Embalming, Greater"
3 Charges
Weight: 0
Usable only on Nameless One and Morte

This intricate metal bracelet has directions inscribed on the side of it. Judging from the text, it appears that the bracelet works by being held by a living creature, then while pronouncing a mantra to the 'True Death,' it is touched to the forehead of a zombie or skeleton. When this is done, the enchantment held within the item spreads through the corpse, strengthening their bones, killing traces of corpse rot and/or grave mold, and helping to seal minor tears in the skin.

It appears that this bracelet has been forged with a great deal of skill and care. Presumably it is more powerful than some of the standard embalming charms.

Weight: 5

This worn, leather-bound tome lists diagrams and charts detailing several minor wards and enchantments. There are numerous drawings of skeletons, bones, and the manner by which they may be preserved over time. 

Of particular interest is the section regarding "guardians." Apparently, the Dustmen animate corpses of fallen giants to serve as guardians for the Mortuary. To make them even deadlier, armoring enchantments are woven into their breastplates to help shield them from attacks. 

The book is much too complex for you to absorb all at once, but it looks as if you could refer to certain sections when the need arises.

This infamous weapon is said to have once been wielded by the assassin Zar 'anun. At first nothing more than a little known thief, Zar'anun soon rose high in the ranks of his guild by assassinating everyone who got in his way. His career came to an end when one of his 'possibly next' victims noticed that the upcoming thief was never without his daggers, keeping them with him even while bathing. When the daggers mysteriously disappeared, so did Zar 'anun.

Invokes: "Embalming, Minor"
3 Charges
Weight: 0
Usable only on Nameless One and Morte

This strange metal bracelet has directions inscribed on the side of it. Judging from the crude text, it appears that the bracelet works by being held by a living creature, then while pronouncing a mantra to the 'True Death,' it is touched to the forehead of a zombie or skeleton. When this is done, the minor enchantment held within the item spreads through the corpse, strengthening their bones, killing traces of corpse rot and/or grave mold, and helping to seal minor tears in the skin.

NOTE: This item will work on either you or Morte. Simply place it in your quick item slot, then use it from the quick menu on Morte (or have Morte use it on you) in order for it to take effect. When cast, the target gains +2-8 temporary hit points and a temporary bonus of +1 AC for a "half-hour." The extra hit points will heal the target if he is less than max hit points or they will give him bonus hit points for a half-hour.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~DUSTMAN EMBALMING CHARM, LESSER

Weight: 0
Usable only by Nameless One

This ivory ring was part of Deionarra's legacy, and through some unknown means, she has enhanced its power three-fold. Where it radiated only a slight glow before, it now burns with a cold, white fire along the edges. The fire does not burn - if anything, it's touch is comforting.

As with wearing Deionarra's normal soulstone ring, you gain added protection from all attacks, and additional protection from any piercing attacks... presumably, the ring's purpose is to shield the heart from shock and trauma, and this extends to any physical pain the wearer suffers as well.

   +10 Fire Damage
   +10% Resistance to Slashing Attacks
THAC0: +2

"Celestial Fire" is the only object that Trias had left to remind him of the Upper Planes. The blade became an axe in your hands. It is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the head. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the axe seems to be burning with metallic flames...someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the axe is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver. 

The axe looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat.

"Celestial Fire" was the only object that Trias had left to remind him of the Upper Planes. The blade became a pair of gauntlets in your hands. They is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the knuckles of the gloves. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the gauntlets seem to be burning with metallic flames...someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the gauntlets is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver. 

The gauntlets look several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within them, and the vibration becomes stronger when they touch human flesh. Not surprisingly, the "Gauntlets of Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, the "Gauntlets of Celestial Fire" burst into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature they strike in combat.

"Celestial Fire" is the only object that Trias had left to remind him of the Upper Planes. The blade became a hammer in your hands. It is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the head. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the hammer seems to be burning with metallic flames...someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the hammer is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver. 

The hammer looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat.

"Zerthimon labored many turnings for the *illithid* Arlathii Twice-Deceased and his partnership in the cavernous heavens of the False Worlds. His duties would have broken the backs of many others, but Zerthimon labored on, suffering torment and exhaustion."

"It came to pass that the *illithid* Arlathii Twice-Deceased ordered Zerthimon before him in his many-veined galleria. He claimed that Zerthimon had committed slights of obstinance and cowardice against his partnership. The claim had no weight of truth, for Arlathii only wished to *know* if flames raged within Zerthimon's heart. He wished to *know* if Zerthimon's heart was one of a slave or of a rebel."

 "Zerthimon surrendered to the *illithid* punishment rather than reveal his new-found strength. He *knew* that were he to show the hatred in his heart, it would serve nothing, and it would harm others that felt as he. He chose to endure the punishment and was placed within the Pillars of Silence so he might suffer for a turning."

"Lashed upon the Pillars, Zerthimon moved his mind to a place where pain could not reach, leaving his body behind. He lasted a turning, and when he was brought before Arlathii Twice-Deceased, he gave gratitude for his punishment to the *illithid* as was custom. In so doing, he proved himself a slave in the *illithid* eyes while his heart remained free."

"By enduring and quenching the fires of his hatred, he allowed Arlathii Twice-Deceased to think him weak. When the time of the Rising came, Arlathii was the first of the *illithid* to *know* death by Zerthimon's hand and die a third death."

Inscribed upon this circular stone plate is the Fourth Circle of Zerthimon:

"*Know* that the Rising of the People against the *illithid* was a thing built upon many ten-turnings of labor. Many of the People were gathered and taught in secret the ways of defeating their *illithid* masters. They were taught to shield their minds, and use them as weapons. They were taught the scripture of steel, and most importantly, they were given the *knowing* of freedom."

"Some of the People learned the nature of freedom and took it into their hearts. The *knowing* gave them strength. Others feared freedom and kept silent. But there were those that *knew* freedom and *knew* slavery, and it was their choice that the People remain chained. One of these was Vilquar."

"Vilquar saw no *freedom* in the Rising, but opportunity. He saw that the *illithid* had spawned across many of the False Worlds. Their Worlds numbered so many that their vision was turned only outwards, to all they did not already touch. Vilquar's eye saw that much took place that the *illithid* did not see. To the Rising, the *illithid* were blinded."

"Vilquar came before his master, the *illithid* Zhijitaris, with the *knowing* of the Rising. Vilquar added to his chains and offered to be their eyes against the Rising. In exchange, Vilquar asked that he be rewarded for his service. The *illithid* agreed to his contract." 

"At the bonding of the contract, a dark time occurred. Many were betrayals Vilquar committed and many were the People that the *illithids* fed upon to stem the Rising. It seemed that the Rising would die before it could occur, and the *illithid* were pleased with Vilquar's eye."

"It was near the end of this dark time when Zerthimon came to *know* Vilquar's treacheries. In *knowing* Vilquar's eye, Zerthimon forced the Rising to silence itself, so that Vilquar might think at last his treacheries had succeeded, and the Rising had fallen. He *knew* that Vilquar eye was filled only with the reward he had been promised. He would see what he wished to see."

"With greed beating in his heart, Vilquar came upon the *illithid* Zhijitaris and spoke to his master of his success. He said that the Rising had fallen, and the *illithids* were safe to turn their eyes outwards once more. He praised their wisdom in using Vilquar's eye, and he asked them for his reward."

"In his greed-blindness, Vilquar had forgotten the *knowing* of why the People had sought freedom. He had lost the *knowing* of what slavery meant. He had forgotten what his *illithid* masters saw when they looked upon him. And so Vilquar's betrayal of the People was ended with another betrayal. Vilquar came to *know* that when Vilquar's eye has nothing left to see, Vilquar's eye is useless." 

 "The *illithid* gave to Vilquar his reward, opening the cavity of his skull and devouring his brain. Vilquar's corpse was cast upon the Fields of Husks so its blood might water the poison-stemmed grasses."

When the brain had been devoured, the husks came to be fertilizer to grow the poison-stemmed grasses of the *illithids.* Zerthimon worked the Fields with no *knowing* of himself or what he had become. He was a tool of flesh, and the flesh was content."

"It was upon these fields that Zerthimon came to *know* the scripture of steel. During one of the turnings, as Zerthimon tilled the Fields with his hands, he came across a husk whose brain remained within it. It has not been used as food. Yet it was dead."

"The thought that one of the husks had died a death without serving as food for the *illithids* was a thought Zerthimon had difficulty understanding. From that thought, came a desire to *know* what had happened to the husk."

"Embedded in the skull of the husk was a steel blade. It had pierced the bone. Zerthimon realized that was what had killed the husk. The steel had marked the flesh, but the flesh had not marked the steel."

"Zerthimon took the blade and studied its surface. In it, he saw his reflection. It was in the reflection of the steel that Zerthimon first *knew* himself. Its edge was sharp, its will the wearer's. It was the blade that would come to be raised against Gith when Zerthimon made the Pronouncement of Two Skies."

"Zerthimon kept the blade for many turnings, and many were the thoughts he had about it. He used it in the fields to aid his work. In using it, he thought about how it was not used."

"The *illithids* were powerful. Zerthimon had believed that there was nothing that they did not *know.* Yet the *illithids* never carried tools of steel. They only used flesh as tools. Everything was done through flesh, for the tentacled ones were made of flesh and they *knew* flesh. Yet steel was superior to flesh. When the blade had killed the husk, it was the flesh that had been weaker than the steel."

"Celestial Fire" is the only object that Trias has left to remind him of the Upper Planes. This heavy blade is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the blade. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the sword seems to be burning with metallic flames... someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. The metal of the blade is unfamiliar... it is heavy, but it shines like silver. 

The sword looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh. Not surprisingly, "Celestial Fire" can be wielded only by those with sufficient strength and purity of heart. When used in combat, "Celestial Fire" bursts into a holy radiance that burns any evil creature it strikes in combat.

The tiny runes etched into the blade are powerful wards that offer the wielder increased resistance against all types of magic. Unfortunately, with its emphasis on magical defense, the weapon's awkward design makes it virtually ineffective in physical combat.

The final achievement of one Kaarlac Cragenmoor, this enchanted knife is a boon to those who practice the mystic arts. Kaarlac, ever one to aspire to greatness, sought to create a magic item that could retain an imprint of a portion of his memory -- particularly the short term memory that contained his considerable spell repertoire. He theorized that, if successful, he could effectively double the amount of spell knowledge he could retain at any given time.  Unfortunately, the enchantment was beyond his capability and in the midst of his fervent casting, Kaarlac went mad and plunged the knife into his own chest. His sacrifice, however, was not in vain, for the knife possesses enough of the intended enchantment to bestow upon its wielder the ability to memorize twice the number of first level spells.

Usable only by Fighters

This magnificent axe, known as "Blindsider," is truly one of a kind. It is rumored that it was the creation of one Akyzum Yar, chief metallurgist of an ancient empire on the Prime Material Plane. The Emperor whom Yar served, a vain and wicked man, commissioned the creation of  "a weapon of unsurpassed beauty." After years of toiling, Yar succeeded and presented the Emperor with "Blindsider," whereupon he was promptly put to death so that his work could never be reproduced. 

The various ores and enchantments employed in the forging of this weapon yielded a new type of metal that is lightweight, durable, and highly reflective. The axe earned its name from its tendency to reflect light into the eyes of its opponent, temporarily blinding the target so that its wielder can easily cut him down. Additionally, its wielder is granted immunity to blinding attacks as a magical byproduct of its reflective nature.

The blade of Trias became a heavy hammer in your hands. It is warm to the touch, and flames have been carved across the surface of the head. The intricacy of the carvings is breathtaking; they are done with such skill that the hammer seems to be burning with metallic flames...someone must have spent several centuries rendering them. 

The hammer looks several millennia old. A faint hum can be felt within it, and the vibration becomes stronger when it touches human flesh.

This is your charred hand; it has been severed at the wrist, and the flesh that once surrounded the bone has been scoured clean, leaving only the stark white bones behind. Despite the lack of muscle and skin, however, the bones of the hand have been fused together so that the bones do not fall apart. The pain of having the hand separated from you was almost more than you could bear, and it left lingering, blackened, scars on your wrists and arm. To make matters worse, you notice that your flesh has healed slowly and poorly from the wound... if Ignus were to attack you with a rage, he might be able to muster enough heat and flames that recovering would be difficult... perhaps even destroy you? The thought doesn't please you.

Ignus has hinted that this charred remain of your hand somehow holds a fraction of his infernal power... now passed on to you. To invoke its power, you must slice off your hand again, place the skeletal hand there, then let the flesh heal over it. When this occurs, the traces of Ignus that remain upon the charred bones will 'kindle' a portion of Ignus' knowledge within you.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~IGNUS' HAND

#52789 ~~~~~BOLTS OF KESSEK THE DEVOURER
(Minor Artifacts)
Damage: 4-8 Piercing
Enchanted: +2
THAC0: +4
Speed: 5
Weight: 0
Proficiency: Missiles

Also called "Kessek's Teeth," the head of these enchanted bolts are made of bone and have two long fangs curving out from the center. When one of these bolts strikes an opponent, the fangs takes on a life of their own and begin eating their way slowly and painfully through the victim's body. 

According to legend, Kessek was a bariaur chieftain on the Outlands who was forced to watch his people starve during a winter storm in the Cleft of Tears many centuries ago. Trapped in the Cleft because of heavy snows, he sent scouts from his tribe out to seek aid from his neighbors, the province of Ohinru. 

Learning of the bariaurs' plight, the merchant princes of Ohinru saw an opportunity to wipe out the "nomadic pests" and claim their lands for their own. The bariaur scouts were executed and their heads mounted on the walls so that, "the vultures might feed while the bariaurs starved." 

When the storms cleared and more than half of his tribe had died of starvation, Kessek finally learned what had happened to his scouts. Consumed with an insane fire, he fashioned a sheaf of bolts from the teeth and bones of his people who had starved to death. Once he had finished, he traveled to Ohinru in the night and fired his bolts blindly in the city streets, the name of each bariaur that had died whispered on his lips as he released each shaft. 

Each bolt he fired twisted in flight, hungrily searching for a victim and each found one... then another, then another. The night was filled with the choked screams of the citizens of Ohinru as the devourers claimed their bodies. 

When dawn touched the city, the vultures fed again. No trace of Kessek could be found.

The bolts of Kessek the Devourer can still be found scattered across the planes. It is said that for each victim the bolts claim, that another bolt is born... with the same hunger as the first. ~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~BOLTS OF KESSEK THE DEVOURER

When compared to the Tanar'ri, at least the Baatezu are more civilized. There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim dragged into the Tanar'rian Madness. Welcome to Hell.

This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them down into the Abyss. The portal remains open even after the victim is swallowed in. The only sound bystanders hear is the incessant screaming of the victim as he/she is torn apart by the ruthless Tanar'ri. After what seems like only a few seconds (which is more than an eternity for the victim in the Abyss), the victim (or what's left of him) gets spit back out of the portal. 
(1) If the victim makes a successful saving throw, he will get spit out of the portal in 'one piece,' but while the victim sensed nothing at first, after a split-second, all the Wrath of the Tanar'ri will surface. The victim will suffer 5-510 pts. of damage as he suffers multiple 'delayed' attacks and slashes from all angles.

This 'spell' is actually a complex mathematical equation accidentally discovered by the modron, Enoll Eva, while calculating the multiplication factor on various linear algebraic formulas. The results are devastating: This equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. Hence it was found that during confrontations, all physical or magical attacks were seemingly doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.

This spell affects a single target. No Saving Throw required. When cast, all subsequent attacks (physical or magical) will be duplicated once: For example, after attacking once with a weapon, the attack will be immediately duplicated - same for spells (cast a Magic Missile, and immediately afterwards, another Magic Missile spell will launch). This spell will last for approximately 2 minutes after casting.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~ENOLL EVA'S DUPLICATION

This 'spell' is actually a complex mathematical equation accidentally discovered by the modron, Enoll Eva, while calculating the multiplication factor on various linear algebraic formulas. The results are devastating: This equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. Hence it was found that during confrontations, all physical or magical attacks were seemingly doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.

A well-known and respected fiend from the Lower Planes, Kalem'Darr was a member of the Fated faction in Sigil. His businesses were spread far and wide, and it was said he had a glittering touch, for every enterprise he undertook was successful. He planned carefully, took few risks, and prospered. Occasionally, he was forced to collect on debts - which could be bloody undertakings, but in the end, he always received his payments.

One day, one of his debtors came to Kalem'Darr and told him he could not settle his debt with coin... but would provide something of greater worth, if the fiend was interested. The man was a hedge wizard of little power, but he claimed he knew the ways of blessing a businessman's eye so that no opportunity would ever escape his sight. Kalem'Darr, both greedy and intrigued, agreed to accept the enchantment as payment.  

It worked... too well, as perhaps the wizard has intended.

Kalem'Darr's enchanted eye soon saw opportunities *everywhere.* Too many to be exploited, and many others the fiend did not know HOW to take advantage of. What his "blessed" eye saw, his hands made broken - every opportunity he tried to take advantage of, his ineptitude mangled. His businesses fell apart, his financial empire crumbled. He soon found himself in debt to his fellows, who had little sympathy for their former competitor. 

Kalem'Darr, unable to bear his reversal of fortune, finally plucked the offending eyeball from his socket and placed it within a cube of glass upon his mantle-piece. Then one day... the eye simply vanished. 

It is said the eyeball itself saw a better opportunity as a free agent, but this has never been proven. 

When placed within an empty eye socket, not only does the fiendish eye grants the wearer a trace of Kalem'Darr's fiendish immunities, it also grants the wearer a bonus to their dealings with others, allowing them to thread their way through a conversation and take what they need. Still, the blinding array of opportunities the eye presents to the wearer blinds him to the opportunities he does take, reducing how much he learns from his experiences. ~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~THE FIENDISH EYE OF KALEM'DARR

Many tales are told of the arch-lich Vecna. 

It is said that Vecna was one of the Planes' mightiest sorcerers, able to draw life from dust and send it back again, extinguish lives with a glance, and make the earth shudder beneath his touch. He was said to be so powerful that when the end of his life drew near, death refused to take him into its kingdom. 

And so Vecna died, yet lived on.

Abandoned by death, Vecna became the master of a vast kingdom on a prime world called Oerth. Neither kind nor just, Lord Vecna's rule was one of great horror and suffering, and it is said his reach was so great that even the Powers of Oerth feared to cross him for fearing of drawing his eye.

Yet, while Vecna's gaze traveled ever outward in search of new conquests, he failed to see his own end when it came for him... in the form of his lieutenant, Kas. 

As was fitting for Vecna's left hand servant, the arch-lich had fashioned a terrible weapon for his lieutenant as a symbol of his authority. Vecna made this weapon with such skill it is said that part of the sorcerer entered the blade, and it was this sliver of Vecna that gave the blade its life and its treacherous nature. Where once there was lifeless steel, there became thought, intent, and, perhaps most horrible of all, a voice. 

The sword whispered treacheries to the ambitious Kas, night upon night, month upon month, year upon year, until one night, the remains of Kas' discipline was seduced by the rippling edge of the blade. Convinced by his blade that he was Vecna's superior, Kas confronted his dread master upon his Dessicated Throne, and the two of them fought a terrible battle. 

During the battle, Kas was killed, but before he fell, his blade had dismembered his former master, scattering his remains so that no one may draw them together again. And so it has come to pass that pieces of Vecna have made their way across the Planes... one of these is the Eye of Vecna. It carries with it a bloody, violent history, so much so that many scholars refuse to speak of its treacheries, for fear the eye will come to them, seeking to add another victim to its bloody chronology.

The Eye of Vecna was instrumental in the extermination of the House of Hyeric, once the ruling dynasty in Nyrond. It is said to have been behind the sundering of the Conclave of Tyssis-on-the-Sea, which led to the three-cycle war that poisoned the seas of Malhatai and left the oceanic world barren of life. On the ashen Plane of Ghalentir, it possessed the gentle father of Sasaran, a babe with the potential to lead his suffering people from their shadowed lands to the Gates of Paradise... had not the eye drove Sasaran's father to murder his son as he lay sleeping in his crib. All these kingdoms, all these futures, the Eye of Vecna laid waste.

The Eye's powers are said to shift with each new owner, but one thing is certain: no good ever comes from whoever has the misfortune to possess it. It is destined to betray its wearer at a critical moment, failing him when he needs its power the most. ~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~EYE OF VECNA

You have met a creature of legend, myth and mystery, and there are few who can claim to have met the night hag Ravel and NOT met some horrible fate. In addition, your skills of speech and presence actually stirred Ravel's heart, marking you as a master of flattery. Although merely wearing it heightens your natural Charisma, you may call upon its power to give you superhuman charisma a limited number of times. 

When the tattoo's charisma bonus ability is used up, the tattoo will remain.

#50818 ~~~~~HEART OF THE FOSTERER
(Minor Artifacts)
Special: Summons the Sohmien
Weight: 1
Usable only by Evil and Neutral Characters

This strange object is said to be the "Heart of the Fosterer." According to legend, the Fosterer was a sorcerer who built his empire upon the Plane of Shale many centuries ago. He was rumored to have 3,333 hearts, and each of them carried in it a different evil he had committed in his lifetime. One of the evils he committed was the discovery of how to summon the Sohmien and bind them to his will. It is said that the Fosterer was carried away by these beasts after he invoked them against some ancient foe, leaving only his hearts behind. 

According to planar scholars, the Sohmien are fiendish horses, said to have been born from the blood of the last of the nightmare lords. They're not so much flesh and blood as an abstract given substance. They come to anyone who seeks revenge and bind themselves to them.

They were born from a great treachery at the Gloom Meet, the time when the fiends gather to speak to the others of their kind. The nightmares ride the skies to gather the fiends to this meeting, acting as messengers. While the fiends saw the nightmares are helpful, convenient allies, they had grown tired of bartering with the last of the nightmare lords for his consent to use them. 

So the fiends called a Gloom Meet only for the purpose of killing. They lured the nightmare lord there to kill him, and when he arrived, the fiends set upon him. He beseeched the other nightmares for aid, but they only watched, their eyes aflame as their lord was attacked. 

The fiends tried to put him in the dead book - they scattered the earth with caltrops covered with the foulest poisons in the hells, hurled barbed cold-iron spears a league wide into him, and when he tried to take to the air to escape, they turned the sky alight with magick, blinding his eyes white. They struck at him with everything in their hateful arsenal - but no matter what they struck him with, he was too proud to die. They hounded him to the edge of the Outlands, firing their cruel arrows and spears into him until he staggered into the Hinterland mists and died there... or so it is said.

It's said that as the nightmare lord stumbled into the mists of the Hinterlands, his dark blood left a steaming trail across the landscape. Wherever his blood fell, the Outland itself cried out, wailing like a banshee, uttering the cries the nightmare lord would not. 

Less than a year later, the Sohmien rode from the Hinterlands, seeking out any nightmares and fiends where they could find them. Their cries were the same as had risen from the blood wounds on the Outlands, and their minds were focused solely on revenge. 

It is said that gripping the heart of the Sohmien and wishing harm upon another will cause them to appear. The Sohmien will answer the user's call, then fade into the mists from which they came.

When compared to the Tanar'ri, at least the Baatezu are more civilized. There is, perhaps, nothing more horrific than the unbounded fury of Abyss. By use of this spell, the ground shall split open and the victim dragged into the Tanar'rian Madness. Welcome to Hell.

This spell opens a planar portal beneath a specified victim and drags them down into the Abyss. The portal remains open even after the victim is swallowed in. The only sound bystanders hear is the incessant screaming of the victim as he/she is torn apart by the ruthless Tanar'ri. After what seems like only a few seconds (which is more than an eternity for the victim in the Abyss), the victim (or what's left of him) gets spit back out of the portal. 
(1) If the victim makes a successful saving throw, he will get spit out of the portal in 'one piece,' but while the victim sensed nothing at first, after a split-second, all the Wrath of the Tanar'ri will surface. The victim will suffer 5d10 pts. of damage as he suffers multiple 'delayed' attacks and slashes from all angles. 
(2) If the victim fails the saving throw, it is instant death. All that is left are body parts. ~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~SCROLL OF ABYSSAL FURY

This 'spell' is actually a complex mathematical equation accidentally discovered by the modron, Enoll Eva, while calculating the multiplication factor on various linear algebraic formulas. The results are devastating: This equation allows all subsequent actions to be doubled or duplicated. Hence it was found that during confrontations, all physical or magical attacks were seemingly doubled - dealing twice the amount of damage.

This spell affects a single target. No Saving Throw required. When cast, all subsequent attacks (physical or magical) will be duplicated once: For example, after attacking once with a weapon, the attack will be immediately duplicated - same for spells (cast a Magic Missile, and immediately afterwards, another Magic Missile spell will launch).

This ropy mass of bloody intestines is yours; Ravel pulled them quickly and painlessly out of your body when she reverted to Marta during your conversation in the Black-Barbed Maze.

You have to admit it makes you uncomfortable to see them outside of your body.

(Unique, Artifact)
Damage: 2-7 Slashing
THAC0: +1
Speed: 1
Weight: 1
Proficiency: Edged
Not usable by Priests

The Sword of Why'nn - also known as the Cheater's Blade - looks more like an ornamental dagger than a combat-worthy blade. Though not particularly well balanced, it has been enchanted with powerful magicks and is thus more effective in battle than a more 'common' knife. The Sword of Wh'ynn's greatest power, however, lies in its ability to let its bearer cheat: by merely holding the 'sword' aloft in a suitably melodramatic pose, its owner will beat whatever game the artifact's been found in.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~SWORD OF WH'YNN

Nordom's Crossbows are not the only gear spirits to have fled from Mechanus - Optix, a somewhat older and more curmudgeonly gear spirit, has been living his last few centuries in an alchemy lab in Sigil. When the alchemist passed away, Optix moved on to various odd jobs, including keg taps, cuckoo clocks, metronomes, corkscrews, and so on, never settling very long in one place. His most recent form, that of a sniper scope, seems to content him for now.

Although Optix is an irritating nag to the two younger crossbow gear spirts, he *has* studied the physiology of creatures throughout the Planes. The two youngsters grudgingly admit (with reluctant, strained clicks) that his advice on how to aim for the eyes and other vital areas of creatures is quite valuable. 

Although it runs contrary to his nature, Optix can actually force itself to be charming to other small mechanical devices... just not for too long . While in Nordom's possession, Optix can be convinced to 'talk' to any locks you encounter and try to persuade them to unlock. This ability is the equivalent of a Knock spell, but it can only be used a certain number of times before Optix gets fed up and refuses to do it anymore. 

Another unfortunate aspect of Optix's presence is that once he's "comfortable," he doesn't like to come off. A Remove Curse will be needed to pull him off of Nordom's head if he becomes too irritating. ~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~"OPTIX"

(Cursed)
Damage: 3-8 Piercing
Special: 
   Poisons Target
  -4 Save vs Spells
   Causes user to go Beserk in Combat
THAC0: +2
Speed: 1
Weight: 1
Proficiency: Edged
Not usable by Priests

Years of being embedded in the flesh of a fiend have imbued this once ordinary dagger with qualities best left with their kind. Blood of the fiend has infused itself with the dagger causing it to feel slightly warm to the touch. 

When in combat the user of this dagger can hear a constant chittering in the back of his mind causing him to lose all self-control making him unstoppable in combat, but vulnerable to spells.

The history of this dagger is for the most part unknown. More than likely some berk perished while fighting the fiend, losing his dagger as well as his life. For now the name is but a description, it has yet to earn a proper title.

#39583 ~~~~~Dak'kon nods solemnly. "I shall impart the tale of 'Ach'ali Drowning.'"

Dak'kon tells the story of Ach'ali, a foolish githzerai of myth who had become lost in the chaos of limbo. Normally, a single githzerai may use their focus and mental discipline to form the chaos around them into a small, habitable environment. Ach'ali, however, asked so many useless and unfocused questions in her quest to return home that her isle of matter dissolved around her, and she drowned.

#39426 ~~~~~[Grace Bio]My past is not a long one, at least by tanar'ri standards. I do not know if you are familiar with the tanar'ri, but we are a race of the Abyss, a staggered series of Planes filled with chaos and evil hearts. 

I am a tanar'ri, a fiend, a succubus... I grew up upon the first plane of the Abyss. My mother was a succubus herself - as I'm sure you are aware, succubi tempt mortals to bring their souls to the Abyss. My mother was among the finest, seducing countless mortal men to their eternal damnation. She now dwells in the Abyss, selling her children into slavery. 

She sold me to the baatezu, the blood enemies of the tanar'ri. I think she rather expected that they would kill me - despite her knowledge of other subjects, she knows little of their culture and the delight they take in tormenting others. 

Fortunately, the baatezu are a proud species. The thought a tanar'ri could best them at anything was something intolerable to them. So I challenged one of the proudest of the balor to a contest of improvisation, and it was here that my tanar'ri heart allowed me to win the day. The tanar'ri are chaotic creatures, wild and unpredictable. The baatezu are more cunning fiends, with orderly hearts. They understand improvisation, but they are not among its best practitioners. And thus, I won my freedom. 

That was a very long time ago. I left the Lower Planes for Sigil. I encountered the Society of Sensation, and my experiences upon the baatezu instilled in me a desire to learn more of the multiverse.

Why? I believe there is a truth to the multiverse... even if that truth is that there is no truth at all. I believe that the Planes are meant to be experienced, and the more one experiences, in traveling, in joy, in pain, in merriment or in suffering, the more the multiverse reveals itself to you... 

And the more you are revealed to yourself.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~[Grace Bio]My past is not a long one, at least by tanar'ri standards. I do not know if you are familiar with the tanar'ri, but we are a race of the Abyss, a staggered series of Planes filled with chaos and evil hearts.

Know that I follow the Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon. His words are known to me. His heart is known to me. 

All that remains is that I know myself.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0

(Unique, Artifact)
Special: 
   Permanent +1 to Save vs. Poison
   Permanent +15% Resistance to Acid
Weight: 3

The Gurgling Stone Gullet of L'Phahl the Gross is not as well known as most artifacts tend to be; no wars have been waged over it, no betrayals, no epic journeys into the underworld... only a few moralizing sorcerers, a fat man, and his stomach.

As the "legend" goes, L'Phahl the Gross was said to have been a promising practitioner of the Art, a sorcerer's apprentice to one of the Last Seers of Es-Annon. Despite his skill at the Art, however, his gluttony was the subject of much ridicule among his peers. 

During the last great Massing of Es-Annon, L'Phahl was invited to dine at the center table, but unknown to him, his peers had filled his wine goblet with an elixir of turning flesh to stone to teach the rotund student a "lesson." 

L'Phahl consumed such great amounts of food and drink during the Mass, however, that it diluted the potion's effects. Complaining of a stomach ache hours after the feast, the local healers discovered that L'Phahl's stomach had turned into stone, yet was still capable of digesting food. L'Phahl lived the rest of his days happily eating, though his gullet was a few pounds heavier than before. 

When he finally died, his stomach was removed as an oddity... and since then, it has 'wandered' the Planes in search of new stomachs. 

To use the artifact, one must consume it (it has the consistency of stale bread)... so doing will turn the eater's stomach into the stone gullet. Devouring the stone gullet of L'Phahl will grant the user the blessing of stone and rock and slight resistance to (stomach) acid.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~STONE GULLET OF L'PHAHL THE GROSS

Special:

Weight: 0
Usable only by Nameless One

This ivory ring was part of Deionarra's legacy. It radiates a slight glow, and though it is cold to the touch, the chill is strangely comforting. The ivory band stretches to fit the width of any finger.

Among the many secrets of the Society of Sensation is the ability to shape a peculiar stone from Elysium, dubbed "soulstone." While this stone is not as powerful as the sensory stones, the soul stone is said to carry an imprint of the shaper's feelings. These rings are often used in Sensate marriage ceremonies, each ring inscribed with the feelings of the other. This ring was obviously intended for you.

When wearing Deionarra's ring, you gain added protection from all attacks, and additional protection from any piercing attacks... presumably, the ring's purpose is to shield the heart from shock and trauma, and this extends to any physical pain the wearer suffers as well.

Weight: 0
Usable only by Indeps

This barbed earring marks the wearer as a member of the Indep faction. This earring is the home of an independent spirit which accompanies the wearer and does its best to protect him from harm. Whenever possible, the spirit gives its wearer a mental nudge to get them out of harm's way... the tiny counseling spirit provides the user with +1 to all Saving Throws, and its mere presence gives the wearer an additional bonus to avoid spells and confusion effects. 

Many of these enchanted items were made in the bazaars of Sigil by a silversmith from Oerth, who had found a way of shaping metal in such a way that it attracted 'free spirits' to the metal and caused them to take up residence there. The spirit is not bound to the earring by any means; from what scholars have determined, there is something about the earring that the spirits find "cozy."

#30455 ~~~~~TEAR OF SALIERU-DEI 
(Artifact)
Special: Permanent +1 Constitution
Weight: 0
Usable only by Lawful Good Characters

This glistening red tear was shed by the martyred Harmonium officer Salieru-Dei when he was put to death on the Harmonium's home plane of Ortho. Mistaken as a member of the hated Revolutionary League, Salieru-Dei's obedience and loyalty was such he could not bring himself to challenge the allegations of his superiors. At the moment of his execution, three tears fell from his right eye and turned to stone as they fell upon the flagstones of the square. 

Ironically enough, an anarchist subsequently revealed the Harmonium's mistake to the public, discrediting them. Ever since, the tears of Salieru-Dei have been considered relics of the Harmonium... and used as a lesson to the evils of unquestioning obedience by the Revolutionary League.

This glistening drop of blood is as hard and smooth as a pearl. When placed on the tongue, it dissolves instantly and spreads through the character's veins and heart.

The heart charm is more powerful than the blood and clot charms, and it heals a number of wounds instantly, even serious or critical injuries. Furthermore, the user will also gain a rush of energy, removing any fatigue they may be otherwise feeling.

Like its younger cousin, the clot charm, the blood charm stimulates the user's blood into clotting and scabbing over existing wounds, healing damage the user may have suffered before consuming the charm. However, while the blood charm's initial healing effect is more powerful than the clot charm, it has no other lasting effects.

The body of this cranium rat has been specially prepared: its insides have been hollowed out and stuffed with various herbs and shreds of papyrus containing arcane symbols. 

When the charm is consumed, the user gains a temporary increase to their reasoning and perception abilities; it feels as if the player is looking through several pairs of eyes and sifting through several minds at once... the sensation is somewhat dizzying for a minute or two, but there are no harmful side effects.

To use this charm, the caster must select a target within his line of sight, then, while remaining focused on the target, untie the charm. The target's vision will turn black for several minutes, rendering them helpless and reducing their combat ability drastically.

When swallowed, the recipient suddenly becomes extremely nauseous... a few seconds later, the charmed individual expels a stream of insects from their nose and mouth.

Cockroaches are as common on the Planes as other scavengers. The shell of this particular dead cockroach has been dotted with paints and faint arcane symbols. The magic contained within the charm is activated when the roach is consumed. 

When swallowed, the recipient temporarily gains the protection of the cockroach. Their skin hardens, taking on the strength of a suit of chain mail armor, and the charmed individual becomes difficult to squash, giving them added protection vs. crushing attacks.

Weight: 0
Usable only by Indeps

This barbed earring marks the wearer as a member of the Indep faction. This earring is the home of an independent spirit which accompanies the wearer and does its best to protect him from harm. Whenever possible, the spirit gives its wearer a mental nudge to get them out of harm's way... the tiny counseling spirit provides the user with +1 to all Saving Throws, and its mere presence gives the wearer an additional bonus to avoid spells and confusion effects. 

Many of these enchanted items were made in the bazaars of Sigil by a silversmith from Oerth, who had found a way of shaping metal in such a way that it attracted 'free spirits' to the metal and caused them to take up residence there. The spirit is not bound to the earring by any means; from what scholars have determined, there is something about the earring that the spirits find "cozy."

This small red gem set into this earring acts like a heat sponge, protecting the wearer from heat or flame attacks. Whenever the wearer is exposed to fire, the gem draws some of the heat into itself, shielding its wearer from part of the damage.

It is rumored that each of these earrings holds a tiny fire mephit inside, and that they are so starved for heat that they will drink deep of any fire in the vicinity. This has never been proven, mostly because no one really cares to investigate the matter.

To activate the earring's power, the wearer must prick his thumb with the stinger, allowing it to bond with its new owner. When "awakened," this earring helps protect the wearer from attacks, giving the wearer's skin the same strength and durability of the larva's shell.

Know this, my Love... I know why you were forced to shield your feelings from me. You sought to protect me from the terrible burden you carry with you. The distance you kept between us was your way of protecting me, and the brief moments when we were alone and you let your feelings be known, *that* was when I knew you cared for me. Carry no regrets with you, carry no guilt, for I came with you on your haunted journey of my own accord, and no matter how death came for me, I know that you did everything  in your power to save me.

Our lives are intertwined my Love, and death shall not be a wall between us.

For my Sight has seen what is to come, only in staccato segments, but it is enough for me to know that we will be separated for a time, but we shall be reconciled again. Thus, do not see my death as a farewell, but only as an interval before we meet again. Carry my ring with you, and these other pieces of me, and think of me. Keep me in your mind and heart, and that will be the beacon that brings us together.

This strange blade is a dead flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It seems as if the blade has become longer than when you first saw it, and it no longer has the same strange shimmering surface it once did. A series of subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade. 

This blade appears to have special religious significance for Dak'kon. He has wound a series of parchments around the hilt of the blade. These appear to be mantras dedicated to Zerthimon.

Weight: 2
Usable only by Dak'kon

This small round stone is the "Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon." The Unbroken Circle is a *zerth* religious text, containing teachings of Zerthimon, the founder of the githzerai people. The Circle is made up of a series of interlocking circles that fold out from one another, depending on which branch the reader wishes to follow in the path of teachings... it is said that some zerths spend years poring over the combinations of the plates, looking for new significance in the teachings. 

Dak'kon seems to use the text as a means of focusing his spell casting abilities, for he pores over the tablet occasionally, memorizing the words.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~THE UNBROKEN CIRCLE OF ZERTHIMON

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter. 

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance; through mental discipline alone, Dak'kon maintains the integrity of the blade. When the spirit and discipline of the user begin to falter, the blade itself will react, mirroring the wielder's thoughts. 

Dak'kon must be suffering indeed, for his karach blade has become a dead flat black, mirroring Dak'kon's eyes. It has become longer, sharper, and a series of subtle jags, like teeth, now line the edge of the blade.

It is not known whether all githzerai zerth carry such weapons. Certainly a weapon that depends on the integrity of the wielder would be entrusted only to those who had learned to discipline themselves.

Weight: 0

My Love,

If you are reading this, then the tragedy I have Seen has come to pass. I have died, and you have remained to suffer the loss.

Know this, my Love... I know why you were forced to shield your feelings from me. You sought to protect me from the terrible burden you carry with you. The distance you kept between us was your way of protecting me, and the brief moments when we were alone and you let your feelings be known, *that* was when I knew you cared for me. Carry no regrets with you, carry no guilt, for I came with you on your haunted journey of my own accord, and no matter how death came for me, I know that you did everything  in your power to save me.

Our lives are intertwined my Love, and death shall not be a wall between us.

For my Sight has seen what is to come, only in staccato segments, but it is enough for me to know that we will be separated for a time, but we shall be reconciled again. Thus, do not see my death as a farewell, but only as an interval before we meet again. Carry my ring with you, and these other pieces of me, and think of me. Keep me in your mind and heart, and that will be the beacon that brings us together.

Forever,

Beyond the level of the ignorant is the level of the proficient, which occurs after the warrior has studied with a weapon. His attacks are no longer hampered by his ignorance of the weapon, and his attacks come more swiftly and surely. 

Beyond the level of the learned is the level of the specialist. At this level, the attacker is not only skilled with the weapon, but he has made it an extension of his will. His attacks with the skilled weapon are faster, and the damage he inflicts greater.

#20651 ~~~~~MODRON CUBE
Weight: 1

This small metal toy is a replica of a cube-like mechanical creature with huge eyes on one of its faces. The toy has two legs, two arms, two folding wings, and at least eighteen points of articulation. Maybe it's a collector's item.

The intricacy of this toy is incredible; its joints are composed of tiny gears, cogs, pulleys, and swivel joints, and there are even tiny springs on the legs that help support the feet. There is a little switch on the back that moves the eyes back and forth, and the wings are made of some tissue-like metal that folds up neatly when the wings are flush with the body. Despite the toy's awkward shape, it rests easily on any surface, no matter how uneven.

#14334 ~~~~~BRONZE SPHERE
Weight: 5

This simple bronze sphere is about a foot across, but it is surprisingly light, as if hollow inside. 

Although its basic appearance is normal enough, this sphere somehow manages to offend the rest of your senses. The texture of the sphere, just the 'feel' of it gives you the impression it's an egg that just about to burst open -- just touching it makes your skin crawl. To make matters worse, the faint smell of rotten custard emanates from it, and it makes your eyes water.

#10081 ~~~~~PENDENT OF YEMETH
Weight: 1

The Pendant of Yemeth is named for its creator, a sorceror of a by-gone age. Though Yemeth's power was great, time began to take its toll on him; he began to grow weak and sodded. The Pendant was commisioned by the dying wizard to serve as a vessel for souls -- souls which Yemeth himself would draw from dying mortals, and later use to power his waning life-force. Yemeth was eventually slain in a battle, destroyed utterly, and the Pendant was lost. Sages said that, even if the Pendant were to be recovered, no mortal knows the secrets of its use.

"The work on the machine continued when Xero died.

#6162 ~~~~~CLIPPED COPPER CHARM
Special:
   Minor Copper Blessing
  +1 to Luck (temporary)
Weight: 0

This copper piece has been "clipped"... most of the copper has been shaved off, no doubt to still keep the appearance it is a coin and allowing the 'clipper' to use the shaved copper to make another coin. Although many Hive dwellers practice this method of "making money," when the Fated faction practices it, they do so with a frightening sense of purpose, creating charms that reflect their own miserly natures. 

In order to create these charms, the Fated faction seek out failed business owners and other individuals who once possessed great wealth, then had a reversal of fortune and were left desitute. These individuals are then given enchanted carving blades and asked to "clip a copper" for the Fated in a tedious day-long ritual, which infuses the copper coin with the last traces of their former luck. The ritual and the nature of the individual clipping the copper allows a minor enchantment to seep into the coin and affect the fortune of the whoever uses it. 

When the clipped copper charm is flipped into the air, it will spill into a rain of copper pieces, and bestow some luck upon the user.

(Minor Artifact)
Special:
   Permanent +1 to Dexterity when broken
   Permanent +1 to Armor Class vs. Missiles
Weight: 10
Usable only by Fighters

This blackened, fist-sized object looks more like a lump of burned charcoal than Xachariah's heart. It is extremely heavy for its size, and cracks run across its surface... it looks like it might break in two at any moment. Handling it leaves strange rust-colored streaks on your hands that won't come off.

Something about the object's weight makes you curious enough to study it for a while; upon closer examination, what you at first took for Xachariah's heart is, in fact, a stone. As far as you can tell, there is no sign that this was ever living tissue. How Xachariah survived with -this- beating in his chest is unknown.

Whatever blessing was laid upon Xachariah's eyes that allowed his arrows to fly true has left its mark upon his heart as well. When Xachariah's heart is broken in two, the breaker of his heart will gain a portion of Xachariah's sight, agility and perception. This gives the breaker a bonus to their dexterity and a chance of spotting and dodging any missiles aimed at them.

Damage: Varies According to Ammo
Enchanted: +1
THAC0: +1
Speed: 10
Weight: 7
Proficiency: Missiles
Usable only by Nordom

Nordom's home plane of Mechanus is driven by great clockwork gears. Tending these gears and making sure they run smoothly are given to creatures called "gear spirits."  These gear spirits have the ability to turn themselves into almost any tool or common mechanical device... even crossbows. Nordom's two crossbows are actually two gear spirits, and they seem to have willingly fled with him from Mechanus. 

Their duties are so essential to the smooth functioning of Mechanus that the modrons have officially assigned these spirits to the various gears. While the gear spirits love the gears they tend so much, their servitude to the modrons rankles them, making them somewhat disgruntled. As a result, there are tales of gear spirits that leave the great gears of Mechanus, leaving their duties for a while to sample the Planes beyond their own. Most likely, Nordom's two crossbows caught this wanderlust, and they now piggyback along with him, peppering any hostile creature they see with crossbow bolts. The gear spirits can make endless supplies of these bolts, so there is never any need for Nordom to reload unless he wishes to fire new crossbow bolts.

The crossbows occasionally make small clicking and rattling noises. They seem to be talking to each other, but their conversation is indecipherable. They're most likely discussing the finer points of crossbow mechanics.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~NORDOM'S CROSSBOWS

This weapon has a black metal handle that seems to have grown into the narrow skull that is affixed to its top. The metal looks as if it has grown out from the skull, and spikes pierce through the eye sockets, jaw and from the skull cap itself.  

The "metal" is not metal at all, but the remnants of a creature's forearm that punched through the base of the fiendish skull that now bedecks the head of this weapon. The spikes that have pierced through the skull actually appear to be some sort of quills from the creature's forearm.

When this weapon is used in combat and the spikes of the club penetrate a creature's skin, acid oozes from the quills into the target, doing additional damage. This acid also burns the hands of the user, doing some damage to the wielder every time he strikes someone else.

The common name of this weapon is "Devil's Due." To who or what event it refers to is unknown, but it was obviously a painful experience for the two parties involved.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~DEVIL'S DUE

If you were to hazard a guess, the entire skull looks faintly reptilian.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0

This tanar'ri femur carries the last traces of a balor's essence within its marrow. Disgraced in battle and torn apart by its fellow fiends in an ceremonial execution, the bone has since carried with it a vengeful spite towards all of its kind. 

When the femur strikes any tanar'ri or baatezu, serrated teeth bristle up and down the length of the bone and cause tremendous damage to any tanar'ri or baatezu.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~FIEND FEMUR

This archaic double-bladed battle-axe is reminiscent of an executioner's axe; the axe head has been forged into the symbol of the Mercykiller Faction (a red dragon with its wings outspread...the outstretched wings have been shaped into the blades of the axe). The axe itself is huge; even wielded two-handed, it would require tremendous strength to use effectively. For a spectral entity, Vhailor must be extremely strong.

This axe is as much a part of Vhailor as his armor, and the axe itself carries part of Vhailor's essence within it. As a result, it is utterly devoted to justice and will not allow the user to rest while "judgments" are left to be delivered. The considerable damage it causes to an opponent is doubled if the axe strikes a  guilty or chaotic creature. Furthermore, the axe itself lends some of its strength to the wielder, giving him added protection from attacks. 

The origin of this axe is unknown. If you were to hazard a guess, the axe gained its powers simply from Vhailor's belief. If he were to die a second death, you don't know what would happen to it. ~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~FINAL JUDGMENT

When its powers are awakened and its name known, "Edge of Oblivion" becomes entirely black...where once just the edges were ebony, now the blackness has spread across the entire blade. The chill the blade radiates has increased ten-fold, so much so that it is painful to hold it for too long.

"Edge of Oblivion" does disintegration damage every time it strikes an opponent...for every wound it causes, it also disintegrates the flesh around the target area, simultaneously cauterizing the wound as it strikes. 

There is some speculation that a Sphere of Annihilation has somehow been encaged within the axe itself, but again this is only speculation. Given that the planes are infinite, anything is possible.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~EDGE OF OBLIVION

Against targets with blood running in their veins (whether their own or another's -- vampires beware), Heartgrinder inflicts additional damage, as every stroke also smashes the target's heart, no matter what location the axe struck.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~HEARTGRINDER

It is not exactly clear in the annals of known planar history when "Hatred's Gift" was created, but by the bloody trail it has left across the planes seems to have finally reached you. 

The axe exists to inspire hatred in one's enemies and fill its wielder with a berserker rage. When entering combat, the skulls along the shaft come alive, chittering their teeth, and the teeth (remnants of fiendish victims absorbed into the axe blade) extend outwards, biting and tearing into opponents with each strike.

The Hammer of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, in 14 E.U.

This war hammer has a huge stone head in the shape of a rectangular block. Faint traces of gore and blood are on all sides of the hammer's head. The shaft is of a thick wood that looks too weak to support the hammer head's weight.

This enchanted hammer was used as a tool by the Athar at one time during their religious persecution phase of their faction history. The magical war-hammer "Foolsmiter" was constructed so that it did additional damage against opponents who were particularly stupid. When it was crafted, however, the enchantment was twisted such that if the user was less intelligent than the target struck by the hammer, the wielder would take damage as well. For many years, the hammer became a test rite between rival members of the Athar as a primitive (and lethal) IQ test. It was stolen from their headquarters in the Shattered Temple many years ago and has resurfaced once or twice across the Planes.

It is believed that the Intelligence vs. Intelligence contest the hammer once inflicted on the wielder and his enemies has dissipated from the hammer over time, but no one has been been confident enough to put it to the test.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~FOOLSMITER

When equipped, the user cannot release the grip until death, or until the curse is lifted by spell or divine intervention. Although the dagger is slower than most two-handed weapons and the damage it inflicts is comparable to a scratch, it is rumored to be able to hurt almost any creature it strikes, no matter what the creature's plane of origin or its defenses.

This feather is ash-gray, fading to black around the edges. It is much larger than a bird feather, and it creates an unpleasant tingling sensation when held for more than a minute.

Examination of the feather reveals that is the feather from a Vrock, one of the many races of tanar'ri that fill the Abyss. The Vrock resemble huge vultures, and they are often used as socuts for the tanar'ri forces in the Blood War. 

This particular feather is believed to have been taken from a Vrock shaman, who is reported to have died by simply disbelieving himself. Possessed of a certain mental imbalance and with an odious habit of devouring his followers to gain strength, this barmy Vrock was rumored to be capable of causing others of his flock to behave erratically -- much more so than for a normal tan'nari. He convinced many of his flock to tear off their wings and take up burrowing in the ground. Other times, he preached the virtues of honesty as being more evil and destructive than any lie. When he disintegrated, only the feather was left behind as testament to his fevered existence. Some of the shaman's residue is believed to reside in this "Chaos Feather."

The Chaos Feather, when used in combat as a dagger, inflicts a minor amount of damage (about the same as a conventional dagger) and has the power to confuse any target it strikes. Creatures struck by the feather may be stunned, run away, or attack their allies. 

Most tan'nari consider the feather to be a sacred object. Vrocks will kill anyone possessing it in order to retrieve it.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~CHAOS FEATHER

These gauntlets have had many names over the centuries. Some have termed the gauntlets the 'Gauntlets of Hunger.' Other terms have ranged from 'Gloves of Greed,' or, among the stupidest, 'the Gnashing Gloves.' The Githzerai called them 'they-which-devour,' and believed them to be an artifact fashioned by the slaadi, the intelligent carnivorous frog-like beings that inhabit the plane of Limbo.

The most common name for this item is the "Gauntlets of Teeth." The exact creature from which the bones originate from is unknown. Nonetheless, when the nature of the gloves is revealed, their power awakens as soon as they are used in combat. When the user punches an enemy, the bone exteriors of the gloves peel back to reveal several rows of teeth. These teeth sink greedily into the foe's body. These teeth are not jagged -- they are mostly wide and blunt, but they clamp onto a target with the strength of a giant, doing additional crushing damage when punching an opponent.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~GAUNTLETS OF TEETH

These gauntlets have had many names over the centuries. Some have termed the gauntlets the 'Gauntlets of Hunger.' Other terms have ranged from 'Gloves of Greed,' or, among the stupidest, 'the Gnashing Gloves.' The Githzerai called them 'they-which-devour,' and believed them to be an artifact fashioned by the slaadi, the intelligent carnivorous frog-like beings that inhabit the plane of Limbo.

The most common name for this item is the "Gauntlets of Teeth." The exact creature from which the bones originate from is unknown.

These leather gloves give the user the ability to use his hands like claws. When the wearer attacks a foe with his hands, long black talons lance forth from the fingers of the gauntlets and allow the user to rake an opponent for additional slashing damage. When the wearer is not attacking, the talons recede back into the gauntlets...although they seem to do so reluctantly. When the talons are not extended, the gauntlets appear to be nothing more than stiff leather gloves.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~GAUNTLETS OF RENDING

This archaic suit of armor is animated by Vhailor's life force. It bears numerous minor dents and scratches, but otherwise, it seems to have withstood the test of time...at least better than Vhailor's physical body.

Blades decorate the shoulders of this suit of armor, and the symbol of the Mercykiller faction (a red dragon with its wings outspread) is emblazoned on the chest piece.

This suit of armor is part of Vhailor... destroying Vhailor (if such a thing were possible) would most likely result in the destruction of the armor.~~~~~ [] #3 #0 #0 ~~~~~VHAILOR'S MERCYKILLER ARMOR
